    question: "Who is this book for?",
    answer:
      "This playbook is for founders, solopreneurs, and builders starting from scratch—especially those without big funding, a team, or a famous network. If you’re rebuilding, hustling on the side, or tired of glossy startup advice, this is for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a technical background to benefit?",
    answer:
      "No. The book covers no-code tools, simple validation methods, and practical steps anyone can use, regardless of technical skill.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just another startup theory book?",
    answer:
      "No. This is a raw, honest guide based on lived experience—not recycled theory. It’s focused on action, survival, and real-world results.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes this book different?",
    answer:
      "Most startup advice assumes you have money, a team, or hype. This book is for those who don’t. It’s stoic, practical, and built for founders in the mud, not on the main stage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this help me if I already have a product?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The principles of lean operation, early monetization, and distribution-first thinking apply whether you’re starting or rebuilding.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the book delivered?",
    answer:
      "You’ll receive a digital copy (PDF/ePub) immediately after purchase. No waiting, no shipping.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. If you don’t find value in the book, email within 14 days for a full refund—no questions asked.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I contact the author?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You’ll find contact details at the end of the book. I welcome feedback, questions, and stories from fellow builders.",
  },
